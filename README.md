# OhioRiver_RS
This repository contains code for creating a dataset of chlorophyll-a and satellite imagery for lakes and rivers within the Ohio River Basin. 

The Matchup_pull file is for pulling surface reflectance over AquaSat sites for Landsat Collection 2. 

The ls_collection2_pull file is not finalized but will be used to pull surface reflectance over all CONUS river reaches for Landsat Collection 2
