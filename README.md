# OhioRiver_SR
This repository contains code for creating a dataset of chlorophyll-a and satellite imagery for lakes and rivers within the Ohio River Basin. 

The LC02_matchup_pull file is for pulling surface reflectance over wqp / lagos sites for Landsat Collection 2. 

The LC02_polygon_pull file is for pulling surface reflectance over all CONUS river reaches for Landsat Collection 2

The SR build file is for applying band correction coefficeints and cleaning up SR pull data into meaningful datasets. 

The model prototyping code is for testing models for predicting chlorophyll-a.
